# 1st Week of 2025  
After the New Year's rush, it was a short week with minimal buzz. But hey, here’s what caught my attention:

---

- **Is OpenAI o1 or Gemini 2.0 more brilliant at math, or is my 10-year-old?** A math problem to test them all
- **Can AI reason like humans?** Sort of. OpenAI o1 might be onto something big.  
- **What’s trending in AI research?** Hugging Face’s top Arxiv picks are showing some impressive breakthroughs.

### Is OpenAI o1 smarter than other AIs at this level of math?  

I had fun discussing this question with my 10-year-old; then, I threw it to all AIs. Interesting.  While other AIs struggled, o1 nailed it! 

"In a sequence where every entry is the product of its neighbors, the 100th entry is 100, and the 200th is 200. What’s the 300th?"

Check out how AIs did:  
- **GPT 4.0**: 100 (Nope!)  
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: 400 (Try again!)  
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: 300 (So close!)  
- **Gemini 2.0**: 200 (Almost there!)  
- **OpenAI o1**: **1/20000** (Bingo!)  

It looks like o1 might be the new brainiac in town!

One more thing. 
* I worked out the answer faster than o1, which uses lots of time going through all the thinking/reasoning for this question. 
* o1-mini did it correctly and fast, much faster than I can. 

### Can AI reason like humans?  
The o1 simulation of human reasoning feels real. The new architecture of the o1 system makes sense. 3 takeaways.
- **Chain-of-Thought reasoning**: Is this making AI smarter than a 5th grader?  
- **Inference time scaling**: AI starts struggling to scale quickly with training time, but o1 found a new way—and it’s working wonders!
- **Consensus-based output verification**: What happens when a bunch of AIs as "generators" and "verifiers" agree?

### What’s trending in AI research?  
In a short week, Hugging Face recommended some cool Arxiv papers — check out these gems:

1. **"2.5 Years in Class"**  
   - **Description**: A multimodal dataset built from over 22,000 hours of instructional videos, designed to help AI models learn effectively from real-world educational content.  
   - **Takeaway**: Your AI just graduated from nerd school with honors for the PhD in ScienceQA and MathVista.

2. **"Xmodel-2": Big Brains, Low Budget**  
   - **Description**: Xmodel-2 demonstrates that high-performance AI can be achieved without requiring massive resources, making it a cost-effective solution for reasoning-focused tasks.  
   - **Takeaway**: Big brains, small wallet. Who knew AI could be so bright without needing to rob a bank?  
   - [Read here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19638.pdf)

3. **"CodeElo": The AI Olympics**  
   - **Description**: A competitive coding benchmark inspired by CodeForces, with Elo ratings for LLMs.
   - **Takeaway**: It's time to see which AI flexes the biggest coding muscles.

### Try Something Cool  

**Minio**: I really like using one API for S3 or my local storage. I have been using Minio. It’s free, it’s awesome, and it might just be the storage hero you never knew you needed!
