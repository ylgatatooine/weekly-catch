# 𝐃𝐞𝐞𝐩𝐒𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝐀𝐈 Gives My 𝐀𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐚𝐩𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐚 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭 – No Upgrades Needed!

Last night, at my usual Friday evening gathering over tea and coffee, the conversation inevitably turned to AI—𝐇𝐚𝐥𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐩 𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐀𝐈 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐜𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐥𝐲 for coding, research, or accounting. The real buzz was around DeepSeek AI R1. It does reasoning and outperforms the free AI models we used. 

DeepSeek AI r1 on Ollama makes my sluggish Intel Corporation-chip MacBook think smoothly, on par with a 10-year-old, in solving this math question. https://lnkd.in/gRZ7UdUc

"In a sequence where every entry is the product of its neighbors, the 100th entry is 100, and the 200th is 200. What’s the 300th?"

**𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞 wins hearts**

Being hashtag#OpenSource, DeepSeek AI r1 delivers excellent performance that ties in with OpenAI o1 in my evaluation. The cost of running and using LLM can drop as much as 90%, notably excites my scientist friends. 

What makes me think is the story behind DeepSeek and its founder, Liang Wenfeng, that we pieced together over the evening coffee.

Liang contributed his journey to his upbringing. With a primary school math teacher for a father, he developed a solid foundation in 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐲 𝐨𝐧. This passion led him to pursue 𝐚𝐧 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫'𝐬 𝐝𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐞 at the university. Later, he ventured into finance, founding and successfully running a 𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐝 leveraging machine learning. Only recently, he set his sights on the rapidly evolving field of 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐀𝐈.

In late 2021, Liang's hedge fund publicly apologized to investors after more than 100 investment products declined more than 10%. These losses were attributed to 𝐀𝐈 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬 struggling with market timing during fluctuations, compounded by the strain of rapid asset expansion. Yet, he persisted, adapting and pushing forward, 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐞𝐞𝐩𝐒𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝐢𝐧 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟑.

Teddy Roosevelt famously said, "It is not the critic who counts; the credit belongs to the one who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust, sweat, and blood."

Or, as we joked over coffee, "Sometimes you’re the AI genius, and sometimes the market reminds you you’re just a guy trying to time trades in your pajamas."
