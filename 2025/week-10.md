# 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐲 𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬 — 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝟗𝟐% 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐢𝐧 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐀𝐈 ⁣⁣⁣⁣

Do you still pay close attention to AI LLM releases? ChatGPT 𝟒.𝟓, Anthropic  𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐮𝐝𝐞 𝟑.𝟕, and 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐮𝐝𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞 dropped in the last two weeks. Are you jumping on the new products? Let’s face it—except for die-hard fans, who's keeping up with so many changes?⁣⁣

So, do new LLM releases now feel like the minor, incremental phone upgrades we get every year?

𝐍𝐨 - They are not the same. We’re getting new LLMs and their product every few weeks, not once a year.⁣⁣ More importantly, many AI capabilities have been improved in each release. Take core memory efficiency as an example. With new algorithms 𝐌𝐇𝐀 -> 𝐆𝐐𝐀 -> 𝐌𝐋𝐀, improvement is 𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞, 90%+,  in a year.⁣⁣

All LLMs (𝐆𝐏𝐓, 𝐋𝐥𝐚𝐦𝐚, 𝐆𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐢) run on Transformer architecture. Attention mechanisms help models focus on relevant information but come at a cost—colossal memory overhead. The more tokens, the more storage needed for key-value (KV) pairs. For example, each token in the KV cache can be 4MB. A long query can take hundreds of GB. 

In April 2024, 𝐋𝐥𝐚𝐦𝐚𝟑 (https://lnkd.in/gnu5nMEg) already improved things with 𝐆𝐐𝐀, cutting memory use per token by 8x (https://lnkd.in/g6WhF6_2

The latest breakthrough in late 2024 is 𝐌𝐋𝐀 (𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢-𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐋𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧). It applies 𝐋𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧, a mature Neural Network technique, to the Transformer KV cache, massively optimizing attention and token memory consumption. Deepseek Research paper (https://lnkd.in/g_irva6c) shows that MLA, applied to any transformer-based inference, can 𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐮𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐛𝐲 𝟗𝟐% 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝟎.𝟓% 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐬. That’s lovely.⁣⁣

⁣So what’s next? 

Will MLA become the new standard, and will an even better architecture soon be released? Could I eventually run a smooth LLM on a 𝐑𝐚𝐬𝐩𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐏𝐢? Right now, 𝐢𝐭 𝐫𝐮𝐧𝐬 ... but super 𝐬𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐲. Maybe soon, we’ll have independent 𝐀𝐈 agents running on wearables—likely an 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐢𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 or a 𝐆𝐚𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧 𝐫𝐮𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫'𝐬 𝐰𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡.⁣⁣
